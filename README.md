STEP 1: Set Up Your Environment
•	Install Python (3.8+) and libraries:
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python tensorflow pytorch scikit-learn matplotlib
•	Use a development tool like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or PyCharm.

STEP 2: Collect Deepfake Datasets
•	Download datasets like FaceForensics++, Deepfake Detection Challenge, or Celeb-DF.
•	Organize the data into "real" and "fake" folders.

STEP 3: Preprocess the Data
•	Use OpenCV or similar tools to preprocess images/videos:
o	Normalize pixel values.
o	Resize images to fixed dimensions (e.g., 224x224).

STEP 4: Use or Train a Model
•	Use pre-trained models (e.g., XceptionNet, ResNet).
•	Fine-tune these models or train a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

STEP 5: Evaluate and Test
•	Test the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score.
•	Deploy the model for real-world detection (e.g., via a web app).
